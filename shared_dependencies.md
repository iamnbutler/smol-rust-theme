1. `UIColor`: This is a struct that is defined in `ui_color.rs` and used in `ui_colors.rs` and `theme.rs`. It represents a UI color with a name, a value, and a description.

2. `ColorScale`: This is a struct that is defined in `color_scale.rs` and used in `color_scale_set.rs`, `ui_color.rs`, and `theme.rs`. It represents a color scale with exactly 12 Hsla values.

3. `ColorScaleSet`: This is a struct that is defined in `color_scale_set.rs` and used in `theme.rs`. It represents a set of color scales with a name and four color scales (`light`, `dark`, `light_alpha`, `dark_alpha`).

4. `UIColors`: This is a struct that is defined in `ui_colors.rs` and used in `theme.rs`. It represents a collection of UIColors.

5. `Hsla`: This is a struct that is defined in `color_scale.rs` and used in `color_scale_set.rs`, `ui_color.rs`, and `theme.rs`. It represents a color in HSLA format.

6. `hsla`: This is a function that is defined in `color_scale.rs` and used in `color_scale_set.rs`, `ui_color.rs`, and `theme.rs`. It creates a new Hsla color.

7. `ColorScaleSets`: This is a map of ColorScaleSets that is returned by the main function in `main.rs`.

8. `UIColors`: This is a map of UIColors that is returned by the main function in `main.rs`.

9. `Theme`: This is a struct that is defined in `theme.rs` and used in `main.rs`. It represents a theme with a collection of UIColors and a collection of ColorScaleSets.

10. Test functions: These are functions that are defined in the respective `tests/*.rs` files and used to test the code in the corresponding `src/*.rs` files.
