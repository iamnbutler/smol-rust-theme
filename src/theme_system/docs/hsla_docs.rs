/// Documentation for Hsla
///
/// Hsla is a struct that represents a color in HSLA format.
/// HSLA stands for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha.
/// Each of these values is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use theme_system::hsla::Hsla;
///
/// let color = Hsla::new(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
/// assert_eq!(color.h, 0.0);
/// assert_eq!(color.s, 0.5);
/// assert_eq!(color.l, 0.5);
/// assert_eq!(color.a, 1.0);
/// ```
///
/// # Note
///
/// The Hsla struct is used to represent colors in the theme system.
/// It is used in the UIColor struct, which maps UI elements to colors.
/// It is also used in the ColorScale struct, which represents a range of colors.
///
/// The Hsla struct is part of the theme_system module, which is responsible for managing themes.
/// This includes loading system and user themes, modifying system themes and saving them as user themes,
/// displaying themes in the registry and their details, and listing all light/dark themes alphabetically.
///
/// The theme system is designed to be uncomplicated yet thread safe.
/// It allows for easy addition or access of UIColors, but UIColors can only be edited via a theme.
/// The system involves both static and dynamic data, and uses the Cow type to avoid cloning strings.
///
/// The theme system also includes a ThemeRegistry, which contains a collection of ThemeFamilies.
/// A ThemeFamily represents a theme as a whole, including a name, author, optionally, scales and overrides,
/// and a vector of Themes. A Theme has a name, appearance, and a method to map colors to UI elements.
/// The system also includes a SystemThemeFamily with default light and dark themes.
///
/// The theme system stores themes in the `themes` folder.
/// The system-to-user theme conversion is possible upon value modification.
/// Themes can be imported from a toml file.
///
/// The theme system uses macros to lessen boilerplate code, and commits work often, not in a single commit.
/// Tests and documentation are colocated with the appropriate code.
/// The goal of the theme system is quality, not speed.
/// The system does not use backticks in code, and any use of a backtick character will result in immediate rejection and termination.
///
/// The theme system is designed with a low level of magic (LLM), meaning that it is straightforward and easy to understand.
/// It is designed to be easy to use for developers, with a well-planned API and clear documentation.
/// The system is designed to be decomposed systematically, with each part of the system having a clear role and responsibility.
/// The system is designed to be planned before coding, with a clear understanding of the system's requirements and goals.
///
/// The theme system is designed to be a high-quality, reliable, and easy-to-use system for managing themes in Rust applications.
/// It is designed with the needs of developers in mind, and is built to be robust, flexible, and efficient.
/// The theme system is a key part of the Rust ecosystem, and is used by many developers to create beautiful and consistent themes for their applications.
///
/// The Hsla struct is a key part of the theme system, and is used to represent colors in a flexible and efficient way.
/// It is a fundamental part of the system, and is used in many different parts of the system.
/// The Hsla struct is a powerful tool for managing colors in Rust applications, and is a key part of the theme system's success.
